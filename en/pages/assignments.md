# Assignments

There are three assignments, worth a total of 12 points, plus a bonus assignment assessed near the end of the term. The purpose of these assignments is to get you to think about design, and to help familiarize you with UI programming basics.

<!-- Assignments are to be completed individually. You may speak to your classmates about the ideas, but are not allowed to use one another's writing or to share code. -->

## A2: User-centered research

## A3: UI Patterns for your project

In this assignment, your task is to present at least 5 UI patterns to be used in your project.


## Bonus: Weekly submissions to #designexamples
Learning how to design effectively is really about thinking about design regularly. For bonus marks (up to 2%, at discretion of course instructor), post regularly to the Slack channels #baddesign and #gooddesign (e.g. twice a week for each week in the term). An effective post includes:
- a photo of an object/interface that is an example of good (or bad) design,
- an explanation for why it is good (or bad),
- and if it is a bad design, a design alternative that solves the problem.
