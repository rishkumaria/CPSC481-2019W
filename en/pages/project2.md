# P2: Ideation and Lo-fi prototypes

Now that you understand your users and their problem, your job is to brainstorm designs for them. The best way to come up with a good idea is to have lots of them, and narrow down. In this component, you will brainstorm many designs, and then use some basic criteria to filter and select the best ideas. You will then polish these ideas, and construct a low-fi prototype -- we recommend Balsamiq but you can use another tool of your choice -- of how you expect your system to be used.


## Major activities
- Brainstorm designs
- Construct a low-fidelity prototype
- If you are using Balsamiq, make the prototype clickable (at least the main workflow of your project)


## Deliverable
You deliver this project component via your project webpage/github page and by doing a presentation during the tutorial of June 11th.
- June 6: deadline for delivering the low-fidelity prototype via your project webpage/github.
- June 11: presentation of what the group did for P1 (User Research) and P2 (Ideation and Low Fidelity Prototypes).
- Each team will have 10min for the presentation. If the team exceeds its 10min, the presentation will be finished by me.
